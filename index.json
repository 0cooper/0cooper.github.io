We present JWST/NIRSpec observations from RUBIES of four submillimeter-selected, ALMA-detected DSFGs at cosmic noon, z∼2.3−2.7. While photometry uniformly suggests vigorous ongoing star formation for the entire sample in line with canonical DSFGs, the spectra differ: one source has spectroscopic evidence of an evolved stellar population, indicating a recent transition to a post-starburst phase, while the remainder show strong spectroscopic signatures of ongoing starbursts. All four galaxies are infrared-luminous (log10LIR/L⊙ \u0026gt;12.4), massive (log10M⋆/M⊙ \u0026gt;11), and very dust-obscured (AV∼3−4 ABmag). Leveraging detections of multiple Balmer and Paschen lines, we derive an optical attenuation curve consistent with Calzetti overall, yet an optical extinction ratio RV∼2.5, potentially indicating smaller dust grains or differences in star-dust geometry. This case study provides some of the first detailed spectroscopic evidence that the DSFGs encompass a heterogeneous sample spanning a range of star formation properties and evolutionary stages, and illustrates the advantages of synergistic JWST and ALMA analysis of DSFGs.\n","date":1728518400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1728518400,"objectID":"be608bce0abcfa33ae59ae96e4662694","permalink":"https://0cooper.github.io/publication/rubies/","publishdate":"2024-10-10T14:57:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rubies/","section":"publication","summary":"Joint JWST/NIRSpec and ALMA characterization of the dust and star formation histories of four canonical submm galaxies","tags":[],"title":"RUBIES: JWST/NIRSpec resolves evolutionary phases of dusty star-forming galaxies at  z∼2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivia Cooper"],"categories":[],"content":"We present the first results from the Web Epoch of Reionization Lyα Survey (WERLS), a spectroscopic survey of Lyα emission using Keck I/MOSFIRE and LRIS. WERLS targets bright (J \u0026lt; 26) galaxy candidates with photometric redshifts of 5.5 ≲ z ≲ 8 selected from pre-JWST imaging embedded in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) within three JWST deep fields: CEERS, PRIMER, and COSMOS-Web. Here, we report 11 z ∼ 7–8 Lyα emitters (LAEs; three secure and eight tentative candidates) detected in the first five nights of WERLS MOSFIRE data. We estimate our observed LAE yield is ∼13%, which is broadly consistent with expectations assuming some loss from redshift uncertainty, contamination from sky OH lines, and that the Universe is approximately half-ionized at this epoch, whereby observable Lyα emission is unlikely for galaxies embedded in a neutral intergalactic medium. Our targets are selected to be UV-bright, and span a range of absolute UV magnitudes with −23.1 \u0026lt; MUV \u0026lt; −19.8. With two LAEs detected at z = 7.68, we also consider the possibility of an ionized bubble at this redshift. Future synergistic Keck+JWST efforts will provide a powerful tool for pinpointing beacons of reionization and mapping the large-scale distribution of mass relative to the ionization state of the Universe.\n","date":1721088000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721088000,"objectID":"ff170c5ef0e81d88f80a74ccfd6b5ae7","permalink":"https://0cooper.github.io/publication/werls/","publishdate":"2024-07-16T14:57:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/werls/","section":"publication","summary":"First results from a large spectroscopic survey of Lyman-alpha emission from bright EoR galaxies, ultimately aiming to pinpoint massive beacons of reionization","tags":[],"title":"The Web Epoch of Reionization Lyman-alpha Survey (WERLS).

Here, we present a pilot study obtaining follow-up Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 2 mm observations of a complete sample of 39 850 μm-bright dusty galaxies in the SSA22 field. Empirical modeling suggests 2 mm imaging of existing samples of DSFGs selected at 850 μm-1 mm can quickly and easily isolate the ‘‘needle in a haystack’’ DSFGs that sit at z \u0026gt; 4 or beyond. Combining archival submillimeter imaging with our measured ALMA 2 mm photometry (1σ ~ 0.08 mJy beam-1 rms), we characterize the galaxies’ IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and use them to constrain redshifts. With available redshift constraints fit via the combination of six submillimeter bands, we identify 6/39 high-z candidates each with \u0026gt;50% likelihood to sit at z \u0026gt; 4, and find a positive correlation between redshift and 2 mm flux density. Specifically, our models suggest the addition of 2 mm to a moderately constrained IR SED will improve the accuracy of a millimeter-derived redshift from Δz/(1 + z) = 0.3 to Δz/(1 + z) = 0.2. Our IR SED characterizations provide evidence for relatively high-emissivity spectral indices (\u0026lt;β\u0026gt; = 2.4 ± 0.3) in the sample. We measure that especially bright (S 850μ m \u0026gt; 5.55 mJy) DSFGs contribute ~10% to the cosmic-averaged CSFRD from 2 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 5, confirming findings from previous work with similar samples.\n","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"cad43e68f794cdc5f54cce573c37ebbb","permalink":"https://0cooper.github.io/publication/2mm-ssa22/","publishdate":"2019-11-14T14:57:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2mm-ssa22/","section":"publication","summary":"Pilot study of the 2mm technique for efficient selection of high redshift dusty starbursts","tags":[],"title":"Searching Far and Long.

We examined syllabus content for 74 general climate change courses taught at the undergraduate college‐level to investigate the scope and extent to which these climate change courses include key topics to advance climate literacy. By analyzing the textual data, we discovered most courses had a strong focus on biogeophysical science and only 8.8 and 9.4% of the terms that occurred in this sample were connected to climate change solutions and communication, respectively. The fine category “Organisms,” which includes terms for specific animals such as “jellyfish” and “urchin” and related terms like “species”, was only observed in 26% of the syllabi; and the term “biodiversity” was mentioned seven times, “extinction” four times, and “animal” was mentioned two times across all 74 syllabi. This reveals a potential gap in addressing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, and the role of some species in regulating climate. We recommend educators include a broader array of inter‐disciplinary topics, place‐based information, communication strategies, and mitigation and adaptation solutions to bridge the gap between climate science, literacy, and action.\nCheck out my blog post summary of the article here.\n","date":1565222400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565222400,"objectID":"38dc13b70668edacda82b58a314316d9","permalink":"https://0cooper.github.io/publication/cooper-curriculum-2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-14T14:57:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cooper-curriculum-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Examination of college-level climate change syllabi to assess curriculuar gaps related to place‐based information, communication strategies, and mitigation and adaptation solutions","tags":[],"title":"Curriculum gaps for adult climate literacy","type":"publication"}]
