Here, we present a pilot study obtaining follow-up Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) 2 mm observations of a complete sample of 39 850 μm-bright dusty galaxies in the SSA22 field. Empirical modeling suggests 2 mm imaging of existing samples of DSFGs selected at 850 μm-1 mm can quickly and easily isolate the ‘‘needle in a haystack’’ DSFGs that sit at z \u0026gt; 4 or beyond. Combining archival submillimeter imaging with our measured ALMA 2 mm photometry (1σ ~ 0.08 mJy beam-1 rms), we characterize the galaxies’ IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and use them to constrain redshifts. With available redshift constraints fit via the combination of six submillimeter bands, we identify 6/39 high-z candidates each with \u0026gt;50% likelihood to sit at z \u0026gt; 4, and find a positive correlation between redshift and 2 mm flux density. Specifically, our models suggest the addition of 2 mm to a moderately constrained IR SED will improve the accuracy of a millimeter-derived redshift from Δz/(1 + z) = 0.3 to Δz/(1 + z) = 0.2. Our IR SED characterizations provide evidence for relatively high-emissivity spectral indices (\u0026lt;β\u0026gt; = 2.4 ± 0.3) in the sample. We measure that especially bright (S 850μ m \u0026gt; 5.55 mJy) DSFGs contribute ~10% to the cosmic-averaged CSFRD from 2 \u0026lt; z \u0026lt; 5, confirming findings from previous work with similar samples.\n","date":1651363200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651363200,"objectID":"cad43e68f794cdc5f54cce573c37ebbb","permalink":"https://0cooper.github.io/publication/2mm-ssa22/","publishdate":"2019-11-14T14:57:01-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2mm-ssa22/","section":"publication","summary":"Pilot study of the 2mm technique for efficient selection of high redshift dusty starbursts","tags":[],"title":"Searching Far and Long.
